=== Generated routes files comments

Routes files generated by the compiler contain comments which are changing across builds (absolute path and date depending on the framework version), this prevents tasks using those files as inputs to benefit from build cache.
The plugin is post-processing those files to remove timestamp and convert absolute paths to relative paths.
